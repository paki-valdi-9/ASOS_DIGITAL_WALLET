To deploy the app install all dependencies, set up a local MySql server and make a .env file with the following variables:

MYSQL_HOST = 

MYSQL_USER = 

MYSQL_PASSWORD = 

MYSQL_DATABASE = 

API_SECRET= 

for testing u can restore .sql database from ASOS_Digital_Wallet_DB dev branch.

I will also place some example requests into the above repo.

once set up simple do "node app.js"
