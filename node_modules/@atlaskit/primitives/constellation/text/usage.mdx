## Usage

UI text variants should be used in cases where line height being equal to the font size is desired. This is likely to be in UI components such as buttons.

Body text variants should be used for multi-line text. For each variant, we have coupled a line height which fits the variant's font size, ensuring that it is compliant with accessibility standards.
